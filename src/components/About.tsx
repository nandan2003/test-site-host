            Sanketa is an independent systems studio that designs intelligent automations, logic-driven workflows, and deployable AI agents. Our focus is functional precision systems that understand goals, respond to context, and operate without brittle rules. Built by a solo engineer, Sanketa combines system design, AI reasoning, and full-stack automation in one place. No fluff. Just engineered intelligence.

              We don't offer templates. We build thinking systems that respond to real-world inputs. Whether it's automating internal ops, building context-aware workflows, or deploying autonomous AI agents, Sanketa delivers systems that work like intelligent teammates. Every build is modular, extensible, and grounded in execution â€” not theory. You bring the objective. We translate it into logic, tools, and action.
